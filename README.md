# QuickClassEval
### Project designed for Practicing TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)

## Description
QuickClassEval is a management program that enables students to evaluate their past and current classes using forms generated by their department coordinators. It is designed to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing student feedback to enhance the quality of education.

## Features
### Sign-Up Email for Students
As an administrator, I want to send a sign-up email to each student so they can register themselves on the system.
#### Status:
[PARTIALLY DEVELOPED] [MOCKED]
#### Description:
The system currently does not send the actual sign-up key to the student's email. Instead, the sign-up key is mocked with a standard value: "TOKEN_587".
